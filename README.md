# FairVision - Detecting and Mitigating Bias in CNN Age Classification

An end-to-end Deep Learning and computer vision project focused on analyzing, detecting, and mitigating demographic bias (gender, race, ethnicity) within a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained for age group classification. Built using **PyTorch**, **Hugging Face Datasets (FairFace)**, and **Streamlit** for interactive model evaluation and demographic transparency.

## 📌 Repository Overview

CAME (Complete AI & Model Engineering) is an end-to-end machine learning repository that demonstrates the full lifecycle of an AI system — from data preprocessing to model deployment and fairness evaluation.

This project focuses on building **robust, modular, and responsible AI systems**, combining model performance with critical ethical considerations such as bias detection and algorithmic mitigation.

### 🎯 Key Objectives
- Develop a complete, production-ready **AI/ML pipeline**.
- Build customized **CNN architectures from scratch** without relying on pre-trained transfer learning weights.
- Evaluate model classification thresholds comprehensively across **different demographic groups**.
- Detect, isolate, and structurally **reduce systemic bias in predictions**.
- Maintain a **clean, scalable project workspace**.

### 🧠 Core Features
- Complete ML workflow loop (data ingestion → structural preprocessing → model tuning → local deployment).
- Deep Convolutional Neural Network custom blueprint tailored for multi-class facial image frames.
- Algorithmic bias mitigation modules (dynamic class weighting, statistical data balancing).
- High-reusability modular codebase separating runtime interfaces from underlying tensor layers.

### Module Breakdown
* **`MLModel.py`**: Defines the Convolutional Neural Network architecture in PyTorch. Implements customized forward execution paths to predict age groups while providing hooks to extract latent features for demographic parity tracking.
* **`FairVision.ipynb`**: Contains structural research routines including data balancing operations, bias metric evaluation loops (e.g., disparate impact ratio, equalized odds), model training, and optimization.
* **`streamlit_app.py`**: Operates as a dashboard interface that processes uploaded user images or sample files, outputs CNN classification metrics, and displays live bias telemetry charts across different intersectional demographic slices.

## 🛠️ Installation & Virtual Environment Setup

This workflow is optimized to execute deterministically within a dedicated environment using **PowerShell** on **Windows**.

### 1. Initialize Project Environment
Open your PowerShell console, change directory to your core execution workspace path, and build your isolated virtual environment:

```powershell
# Navigate into the project folder
cd "D:\"

# Build an isolated Python virtual runtime workspace
python -m venv .venv

# Adjust system execution permissions for the local process terminal instance
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process

# Activate the local virtual path script
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 2. Install Package Dependencies
Execute batch installation parameters to ingest computer vision modules, web-rendering architectures, data optimization layers, and PyTorch components:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: If requirements.txt is empty or missing specific targets, fallback manually to the foundational pipeline tools:*
```powershell
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib datasets pyarrow scikit-learn seaborn
```

- Intersectional Precision, Recall, and F1-Scores.
- Segmented Confusion Matrices.
- Group-wise classification parity across distinct demographic buckets.

### ⚖️ Fairness & Bias Mitigation System
To counteract real-world data collection imbalances, the script incorporates active algorithmic mitigation methods:
- **Demographic-based Evaluation**: Explicit performance metrics tracked per protected attribute subset.
- **Bias Detection**: Mathematical scoring of Disparate Impact and Equalized Odds variance.
- **Active Structural Mitigation**:
  - *Class Weighting*: Penalty scaling inside loss functions based on demographic sample frequencies.
  - *Oversampling*: Enhancing low-density group visibility across training iterations.
  - *Balanced Batch Training*: Enforcing demographic equilibrium inside forward steps.

## 💻 Running the Interactive Dashboard

Once your environment variables and dependency weights are established, execute the local Streamlit dashboard application to audit the CNN age prediction models.

```powershell
# Run the core dashboard utility script
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

*Application Verification Features:*
* **Image Evaluation Hook**: Upload raw images or pick from the localized sample path (`fairface_sample/images/`).
* **CNN Classification Analysis**: Decodes age brackets (e.g., 0-2, 3-9, 10-19, 20-29, etc.) alongside evaluation prediction confidence intervals.
* **Bias Profiling Summary**: Compares confusion matrices across available protected variables to confirm equalized odds compliance.
